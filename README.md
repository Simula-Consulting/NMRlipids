# Tutorial showing how a neural net can be trained to predict total densities from form factors with the NMR lipids database

The notebook step by step: 
* Initialize the NMR lipids databank
* Gather form factors and total densities in data frames
* Preprocess the data to deal with missing data and different data dimensions
* Split pairs of form factors and total densities into a train and a test set
* Train and evaluate a machine learning model
