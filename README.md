# Tutorial showing how a neural net can be trained to predict total densities from form factors with the NMR lipids database

The notebook step by step: 
1) Download the data using the [NMR lipids API](https://nmrlipids.github.io/databankLibrary.html).  
2) Explore the data, and preprocess the data for the machine learning pipeline.  
3) Split data into train and test sets.
4) Implement different neural networks and perform hyperparameter tuning
5) Train and evaluate the performance of the neural networks.
